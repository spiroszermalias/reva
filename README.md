# ReVa
ReVa (Request Vacation) is the go-to project to manage employee requests for vacations!

## How ReVa may help you
ReVa streamlines the vacation request and approval proccess through simplicity and automation.
It exposes a dashboard for the users to submit their requests and you only have to click on the "approve" or "reject" link
that will automatically be sent to you after the user's submission. The user will be notified immediately of your decision.

## Installation
Installation is really easy with ReVa and you're only required to perform the least amount of steps possible ðŸ™ƒ.
You should be good to go in a few minutes following these steps:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://{username}:{password}@github.com/spiroszermalias/reva.git`.
Replace {username} and {password} with your credentials.

2. Create an empty MySQL or MariaDB database and a user with full privileges on the database.
Place the credentials in prod-config.php and/or dev-config.php under the config dir*.
ReVa will populate the database automatically.

3. Run `composer update` to install dependencies.

4. After you make sure that you have set `/public` dir as your webserver's document root,
visit `example.com/setup` (if your domain would be example.com). This will allow you to
add the first admin user. Voila!

*These two files are identical and are meant to be used in case you need to seperate
development from production-specific configuration constants. The config that gets loaded
is controlled by the master config.php located in the same dir, by setting `APP_MODE`.

## Basic usage
Usage is pretty simple. Below, usage is referenced based on the two distinct user roles:

###### Admins
As an 'admin' user you may perform these actions:
* Register new users.
* Edit existing users.
* Approve or reject vacation requests.
You are also able to submit vacation requests yourself but whether or not this makes sense, depends on you/organization and your workflow.

###### Employees
As an 'employee' user:
* Submit requests for vacation time, stating the reason and date-range.
* Watch your request history, info and state

## Mumbo jumbo
For the more tech savvy out there, you may be instrested in the following technical notes to keep in mind
in case you need to extend or tweak the codebase.

###### Project structure
Most of the code that you may need to deal with is in the /App directory. Directory tree:
```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€App
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€Controller
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€Model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€views
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€global
```

###### Security and user sessions
Loging in by default sets the session lifetime to a month.
